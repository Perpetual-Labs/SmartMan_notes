# Intro
Robust modelling and simulation of the manufacturing process and of the [[Service networks]] is necessary to perform advanced analysis, e.g. process and supply chain design, optimisation and trade of studies . More rapid innovation and flexibility can be facilitated by modular simulation and modelling techniques [[Brettel et al. 2014]]

A key challenge is the diversity of underlying computational tools, each designed for a different task such as data manipulation, statistical learning, data mining, optimisation and simulation. Because of this diversity, modelling using computational tools often requires the use of specialised low-level mathematical abstractions. As a result, the same manufacturing knowledge is often modelled multiple times using different specialised abstractions, instead of being modelled once using a uniform abstraction. This leads to high-cost and long-duration development of manufacturing analysis and optimisation solutions, and results in models and algorithms that are difficult to modify, extend and reuse.

Moreover, the modelling expertise required for the low-level abstractions and languages is typically not within the realm of knowledge of manufacturing users. 

> Part of the challenge of developing service network analysis systems lies in the complexity of developing high-level tools and applications, which support the different user workflows, from inadequately granular abstractions provided by these low-level tools. Typically, such applications are implemented directly using the low-level tools, from scratch, following a linear development methodology. Furthermore, due to the diversity of low-level tools, applications implemented using one tool are difficult to modify, extend and reuse with other tools. As a result, the same manufacturing knowledge is often modelled multiple times using different, specialised abstractions, instead of being modelled just once using a single, uniform abstraction.

# Examples:
- Otto et al. presented a simulation-based method that attempts to re-use existing software components used to formally characterise seemingly disparate production realisations to test new reconfiguration designs [[Otto, Vogel- Heuser, and Niggemann 2018]]. 
- Denno and Kim presented an ontology-based approach for re-using components of predictive models for optimising the performance of a selective laser sintering process [[Denno and Kim 2016]].
- [[Factory Optima]]



Developing tools and methods for service composition remains an ongoing research area and requires generic and [[Wu et al. 2013]]
