cultural change is definitely anissue and we need to get more feedback from potential end users. What, to me, sounds interesting about decentralised systems like Solid and Ocean is that each stakeholder keeps ownership of their data (both physical and legal in the sense that the data are stored in a container that they own and control) and they have tight control on who can access it and for what. Instead of Having a centralised entity to which they have to delegate control of your data. I think this aspect could help with the cultural bias against cloud

Examples:
- Ocean Protocol
- Solid
