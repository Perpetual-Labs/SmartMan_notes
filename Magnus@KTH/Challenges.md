- Lack of integration of information, tools and work methods
> [[Process design]] and [[Quality planning]] are interrelated, but lack of efficient integration as well as lack of effective work methods and media that can represent vital manufacturing information hinders them from being executed in a mutually beneficial concurrent manner. Today ́s document-based work methods are very time-consuming as lots of different documents have to be created, managed, and maintained in process planning and quality planning. Lot of the information is common but is described in a fragmented manner across many different documents with information duplication as an inevitable consequence.
> Unfortunately, today ́s work methods fail to take advantage and exploit the outcome of these valuable considerations in quality planning, as current tools lack effective ways to integrate the reasoning and rationale behind process planning decisions [Lundgren et al. 2019]].
> Software for process and quality planning from companies such as Siemens, Dassault, ReliaSoft, IQS, etc.  was examined in a study in collaboration with Swedish automotive manufacturing companies [[12]]. A gap was identified in the sense that current mainly document-based work methods in quality planning fail to capitalize on already created information from process planning. Furthermore, lack of software interoperability in process and quality planning results in information fragmentation, data duplication, and possible data inconsistency.
