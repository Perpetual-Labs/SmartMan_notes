# Intro
One method for realising a Smart Manufacturing ecosystem is to employ an over-arching cloud-based infrastructure that supports decision-making, knowledge management and data sharing across the entire hierarchy of the extended enterprise, including manufacturing units, cells, production lines, factories and supply chains [[Salvendy 2001]] [[Wu et al. 2013]]. 

Examples:
-  distributed computing resources [[Xu 2012]]
-  Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) community specifically, recent developments aim to build fully aware and resilient manufacturing systems that react quickly and appropriately to environmental signals through cloud-based resources [[Lee et al. 2014]]
-  use of the cloud for performing advanced data analytics to predict tool wear during machining operations [[Wu et al. 2018]]
-  Ren et al. presented the primary characteristics associated with fully implementing a cloud manufacturing environment, across the entirety of a large aerospace company operating over 600 subsidiary companies [[Ren et al. 2017]].

Challenges: scalability, security and interoperability 
- > A recent state-of-the-art review on cloud manufacturing emphasised these points by listing six primary research directions [[He and Xu 2015]]: (1) additional standards development, (2) multi-cloud integration, (3) security policies, (4) resource utility management, (5) systems integration and (6) stakeholder adoption. Echoing these challenges. 
- > However, lack of standard guidelines for the underlying architecture, such as sensor selection, data transmission and database creation, limit cloud-based architecturesâ€™ scalability, reproducibility and interoperability [[Gao et al. 2015]] [[Lee 2003]]
