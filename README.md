This is a work in progress literature review for the Smart Manufacturing

Rules:

I typically start in the "Uncategorized folder" where I take notes about specif references (ex. paper, article, tutorial, etc.)
then I review my note and start organising the concepts (one note per concept) and the relationship between the concepts (using hyperlinks)
at this point, I move notes to the main folder
it possible to copy and paste images in the notes (move the files in the Images folder)
For references, create and note in the "References" folder with the Webaddress and a description (if necessary) and link to the note when you need to cite the reference
