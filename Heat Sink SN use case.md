[[Factory Optima]] is demonstrated using a case study of a service network for a heat sink product which involves contract vendors and manufacturing activities, including cutting, shearing, Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining with milling and drilling operations, quality inspection, finishing, and assembly.

Figure 1 provides an example of a service network for an assembly of a heat sink product, consisting of an aluminium base, a heat sink component and a set of fasteners.

The process engineer models the Heat Sink service network from Figure 1 by creating input instances for the [[Performance Models|PMs]] stored in the [[Industry Knowledge Base|industry KB]]. For example, the Smelting, HS Shearing and CNC Machining processes in Figure 1 are instances of the  [[Unit Manufacturing Process|UMP]] PMs Smelting, Shearing and CompositeMachining respectively. Similarly, the Alumina, HS Base Contract Manufacture and Heat Sink Service Network processes in Figure 1 are instances of the service network PMs VendingService, MfgService and CompositeService respectively.

Within the service network, each activity and physical good is represented by an image and a labelled circle, respectively. Vendors can provide raw material, i.e. Alumina Powder, or the finished components, i.e. Accessory Package. As an example of a contract manufacturer, the HS Base Contract Manufacture provides the service of machining a part for the product’s final assembly. Within service networks, it is likely that there are multiple paths that provide the same physical good. Often, this is referred to as a multi-echelon supply chain (Tsiakis, Shah, and Pantelides 2001). Procuring the Heat Sink Base presents an example of such a situation. The Heat Sink Base can either be provided by a contract manufacturer or it can be provided by the OEM’s own production line, shown in the dotted box in the middle of the diagram. This production line includes two unit manufacturing processes, namely shearing and drilling. Another such example is the procurement of the Aluminum Plate, wherein the OEM operates its own smelting plant or the aluminium bar stock is cut to specifications by another contract manufacturer. The Heat Sink’s service network culminates in a relatively complex production line that includes five activities, namely shearing, anodising, CNC machining, quality inspection and final assembly.

In the Heat Sink service network in Figure 1, fixed parameters include the type of material used, its dimensions, the number of holes during the HS Base Drilling activity, depth of cut in the CNC Machining activity, among others. Control parameters in the service network include the cutting speed in an HS Shearing activity, cutting speed in an HS Base Drilling activity and the amount produced by the Aluminum Plate Contract Manufacture, to name a few.
