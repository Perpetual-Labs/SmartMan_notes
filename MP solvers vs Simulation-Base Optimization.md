While [[Modular simulation and modelling|simulation-based modelling]] approaches have advantages of modularity, reusability and easy visualisation, simulation-based optimisation is inferior to mathematical programming (MP) solvers. In terms of quality of optimisation results and computational efficiency, MP solvers significantly outperform simulation-based solvers for optimisation problems expressed in closed analytic form [[Amaran et al. 2016]] [[Klemmt et al. 2009]].
